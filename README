Updated source to Dart Editor Build 7552
after finding that the compiled js file
no longer ran under newer releases of Chrome.
The following changes were required in the
source:
_feedCont = window.document.query('#feedContainer');
is now:
_feedCont = document.query('#feedContainer');

and:
xhr = new XMLHttpRequest.getTEMPNAME(feedURL, (jsonRequest)
is now:
xhr = new XMLHttpRequest.get(feedURL, (jsonRequest)
